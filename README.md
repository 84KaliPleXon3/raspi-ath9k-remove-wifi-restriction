# raspi-ath9k-remove-wifi-restriction
A raspi kernel patch to remove wifi restrictions. Suitable for ham radio usage

Based on [hatsunearu/EZ-WifiBroadcast](https://github.com/user/hatsunearu/EZ-WifiBroadcast). Should apply to 4.4.y branch correctly on the [official raspi linux repo](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux)
